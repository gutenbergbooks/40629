<p><span class="smcap">Dear Toby</span>,</p>

<p>I am, as you will understand, so busy in my preparations for departure,
that I fear I may not find time to call upon you, <i>p.p.c.</i>, and
therefore take up my pen to write these few lines, hoping they will find
you well, as they leave me at present. It is an odd reflection to one
who has reached my time of life, that henceforward sixteen-shilling
trousers shall have no more interest for me. Already, in the privacy of
my room, I don the flowing robes of the East, and sit by the hour as you
see me in a little sketch I have had made, and beg your acceptance
herewith. It is all very strange to me yet. As <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> says, it is the
oddest thing in the world that the Ark and I, after much tossing about
in troublous waters, should finally settle down in the neighbourhood of
Ararat. If I had had my choice, I would not have gone so far afield. The
wise men, you know, come from the East, they do not go there; at least,
not further than Constantinople, which would have suited me admirably.
Rome I have eyed askance. I could have dressed the part for St.
Petersburg. Berlin would not have been bad; and I feel that I was born
for Paris. But the Markiss of course has his way, and he has mapped mine
out for Teheran.</p>

<p>It is odd to reflect (and as I sit here trying to grow accustomed to the
hookah, I feel in a reflective mood) that if <span class="smcap">Br-dl-gh</span> had not been
elected for Northampton in 1880, I would never have been Her Majesty's
Minister at the Court of the <span class="smcap">Shah</span>. Do you remember the night, nearly
eight years gone, when I jumped up from my seat below the Gangway and
physically barred <span class="smcap">Br-dl-gh's</span> passage up the House? In the loose way
history is written, <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> gets the credit of incubating the Fourth
Party. But if it had not been for me, that remarkable cohort would never
have existed, and the history of English politics for the last seven
years would have been written differently. <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> was actually not in
the House when I created the <span class="smcap">Br-dl-gh</span> difficulty. Three weeks earlier,
on <span class="smcap">Br-dl-gh's</span> first presenting himself, <span class="smcap">Freddy C-v-nd-sh</span> had moved for a
Select Committee to consider his claim to make affirmation. <span class="smcap">St-ff-rd
N-rthc-te</span> had seconded the hum-drum motion, the Committee was agreed to,
and there the matter ended. When <span class="smcap">Gr-sv-n-r</span> moved to nominate the
Committee, I came to the front, was snubbed by <span class="smcap">H-lk-r</span> at the instance of
our respected Leaders, but stuck to it then and after, till presently,
the Conservative Party, seeing the advantage, came round to my view and
poor <span class="smcap">St-ff-rd N-rthc-te</span> had to eat his words. <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> came on the
field and the ball was set rolling; but it was I who gave it the first
kick.</p>

<p>And now behold me solemn, sedate, responsible, the Representative of the
greatest of Western Powers at the Court where once <span class="smcap">Artaxerxes</span> ruled! In
quitting Parliamentary life I leave behind me an example which young
Members will find it profitable to study. The opportunities I possessed were held
in common with hundreds of others whom I leave in obscurity. I had no
particular gifts that promised the comfortable pre-eminence I have reached.
The coarsest flatterer could not accuse me of oratorical ability. <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>, I
confess, excelled me there, and so did <span class="smcap">G-rst</span>, an abler man than either of us, but
lacking in the quality that brought <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>and me to the front and kept us
there. What I did, was to keep myself in evidence, and to make myself as
disagreeable as possible to people in authority. If
the object of attack were <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span>, good; if it
were <span class="smcap">N-rthc-te</span>, better, as showing more independence,
and as securing the favourable attention of the
Opposition. It is a commonplace, ordinary thing to be
cheered by your own side. What the young aspirant to
Parliamentary distinction should look to, is to gain the
applause of the Benches opposite. <span class="smcap">R-b-ck</span> knew that
in old days, and so did <span class="smcap">H-rsm-n</span>, and in these later
times <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> better and more successfully than
either.</p>

<p>I quit the House of Commons with unfeigned regret,
tempered only by the anticipated pleasure of watching
from Teheran the coming cropper of my old friends. The
deluge is surely coming for them, whilst I loll landed
high and dry upon Ararat. I like to make <span class="smcap">B-lf-r</span> uneasy
by telling him this. But he boasts of an infallible
receipt the Government have for keeping up their Parliamentary
majority. Here and there a bye-election may
reduce it, "but," says <span class="smcap">B-lf-r</span>, "we can always play
next, and win. For every bye-election lost we clap an
Irish Member in gaol, or, for the matter of that, a
Radical, and thus maintain an even balance. We lose
Coventry and they lose <span class="smcap">O'Br-n's</span> vote. Spalding goes,
and <span class="smcap">T. H-rr-ngt-n's</span> vote is crossed out. Northwich
is lost, and the Lord Mayor of Dublin is lagged. We
lose a vote in the Exchange Ward, Liverpool, and they
are bereft of <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span>, whilst we have left to the good
<span class="smcap">Cox</span> and <span class="smcap">E. H-rr-ngt-n</span>, with <span class="smcap">P-ne</span> safe within the
mud walls of his castle."</p>

<p>That is all very well, but evidently it cannot go on
indefinitely. I at least am out of the scuffle happily, and
in good time, and, political life's fever over, shall live
well.</p>

<h2>THE STRAIGHT TIP.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<h3>(<i>To All whom it may concern.</i>)</h3>

<p>Hasty assumption, by spite inspired,</p>
<p>Spouting in public before you've inquired</p>
<p>Basis of fact or authority's worth;</p>
<p>Wriggles, provoking much cynical mirth,</p>
<p>Roundaboutation, sophistical fudge;</p>
<p>Then retractation, but done with a grudge!&mdash;</p>
<p>Gentlemen, gentlemen, <i>is</i> this good form?</p>
<p>Would you political citadels storm</p>
<p>Like Heathen Chinees with (word) "stinkpots"? For shame!</p>
<p>This is not manfully playing the game.</p>
<p>It is not "good business," believe me, but bad,</p>
<p>Whether you're Tory or whether you're Rad.</p>
<p>Young and conceited, or old and grand,</p>
<p>To tell taradiddles&mdash;at second-hand!</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>THEATRICAL RECIPROCITY.</h2>

<p>First of all came The London Savoyards, who, after
sending their <span class="smcap">D'Oyly Carte</span> <i>de visite</i> in advance, showed
our cousins-German the way to perform Burlesque Opera
of native English growth. Then followed <span class="smcap">Herr Wyndham</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Fra&uuml;lein Moore</span>, who have just been instructing
the Berliners in the art of playing Comedy, and have
achieved an undeniable success in <i>David Garrick</i>. Odd
international combination this, English actors playing
before a German audience a piece adapted by an English
author from a French play translated into German. Our
actors and actresses will go in for the study of German,
and as we now hear in England that German labour ousts
native labour from the market, so we may expect very
soon to hear German actors protesting against the influx
of English Theatrical Companies who are taking the bread
out of their mouths. What will be the next move in this
game? Will <span class="smcap">Sardou</span> adapt <i>The Butler</i> to be played
here by <span class="smcap">Coquelin</span>, in <span class="smcap">Toole's</span> part, and at his theatre,
with <span class="smcap">Sarah Bernhardt</span> as the Cook, just to strengthen
the cast? Herr <span class="smcap">Wyndham</span> appeared at the Residenz
Theatre. We hope he is not going to take up his Residenz
there, as we can't spare him.</p>

<h2>ALTERAM PARTEM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The reason why I have not
hitherto contributed to the controversy
on the recent unhappy (Police)
Divisions is, because I have been
laid up in the Hospital. Never mind
which Hospital&mdash;but I have not been
so comfortable since I had the mumps,
years and years ago, at school. Being
a born economist, I naturally turned
out in my myriads to assist at a
gratis show in Trafalgar Square;
and, Sir, I never came so near realising
what a "dead head" was in the
whole course of a chequered (not to
say chuckered) career. But do I
turn round and abuse the Police?
Why, ever since that fortunate
Sunday, I have enjoyed, at no expense
to myself, the most delicate of
viands, the tenderest of nursing,
and a complete immunity from even
the suggestion of getting anything
to do; and, in addition to all this,
the satisfaction of having employed
the services of a force to whose maintenance
I have never contributed
one farthing. But soft, a nurse
approaches, and I must dissemble.</p>

<h2>A RASHER THEORY OF BACON.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>I. It is plain that the <i>soi-disant</i> <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>
was poor to the end of his days. This
is proved by <span class="smcap">Milton's</span> sonnet beginning&mdash;</p>

<p class="small hang">"What needs my <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> for his honour'd bones?"</p>

<p>This shows that the person in question was
in the habit of selling his kitchen refuse, and
more noteworthy still, that <span class="smcap">Milton</span> was in
the habit of buying it. Whether out of respect
for the vendor, which would go a long way
towards proving the esteem in which he was
held, or because <span class="smcap">Milton</span> was in the marine
store line at this period, I leave to Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly</span>
to decide.</p>

<p>II. It is certain that there is a cypher in
the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. <i>Pyramus</i>
has the line, "O, dainty duck. O, dear!"
Now "duck" stands with cricketers for 0,
and 0 is a cypher (or is it figures that are
cyphers? but, never mind). Therefore we
have here the expression, "O, dainty cypher,
O, dear!" which proves conclusively, that
the cypher was dainty,&mdash;exquisite, elaborated;
and also that <span class="smcap">Bakspeare</span> was heartily
tired of it, unless, "dear" refers to the
terms he had to pay to <span class="smcap">Shakon</span> to hold his
tongue. But the fact that the supposed
author used to sell bones, and inferentially
rags, to <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, rather militates against
this hypothesis. And here note what a flood
of light is thrown upon the disappearance
of the manuscripts. They were indubitably
sold, with the honoured rags and bones to
<span class="smcap">Milton</span>, who has certainly more than one
suspicious coincidence of thought and phraseology,
especially in his earlier poems.</p>

<p>III. My play, <i>Piccoviccius</i>, contains the
clue to the whole matter. There is a picture
on the title-page of a boy blowing an egg,
while an elderly gentlewoman, who is remarkably
like the bust of the poet in Stratford
Church, looks on with every appearance
of interest. Underneath is the legend,
"Lyttel <span class="smcap">Francis</span> teaching his Crypto-gra'mother."
I am firmly convinced that
<i>Piccoviccius</i> was <i>written by both of them</i>.
The style is not the least like that of either,
which proves that they didn't want everyone
to know. I subjoin a specimen. The
scene is the palace of the usurping Duke
<i>Jingulus</i>, who is about to wed the Lady
<i>Rachel</i>.</p>

<p class="author">Yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Roderick Tweddle.</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="smcap">Jingulus</span>, <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>,

<div class="stanza">
  <p class="i2"><i>Jing.</i> Say, <span class="smcap">Philostrate,</span> what abridgment have you for</p>
<p>This dull, three-volumed day?</p>
  <p class="i2"><i>Phil.</i>     <span class="i6">There is, my lord,</span></p>
<p class="i2">A show of cats and tame canary birds.</p>
<p>The cats, sleek sleepy creatures, well content,</p>
<p>Doze fur in fur, the while the nimble birds</p>
<p>Climb ladders, carry baskets, beg for pence:</p>
<p>Which given, they in bills receive, and take</p>
<p>With hops, well-satisfied unto their keepers,</p>
<p>Then the sleek cats sit up and 'gin to spar,</p>
<p>And get sleek heads in furry chancery.</p>
  <p class="i2"><i>Jing.</i> That will we not see at our wedding-time,</p>
<p>No sparring, nor no caging. Well, what next?</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Phil.</i> A hunch-back'd man, long-nosed, there is, my lord,</p>
<p>Who in a curtained tabernacle dwells,</p>
<p>Himself, his wife, his child, a helpless babe,</p>
<p>His dog, of rare sagacity, though small,</p>
<p>Is full as large as all the family.</p>
<p>The man a cudgel bears, and carries it</p>
<p>As though he lov'd it. Spurning household cares,</p>
<p>To pity dead, he through the window flings</p>
<p>His wailing, helpless babe, nor spares the p&aelig;an</p>
<p>Of nasal triumph and the drumming foot.</p>
<p>The mother thus bereav'd, such comfort gets</p>
<p>As in the cudgel lies, and joins too soon</p>
<p>Her infant sped. Again the nasal song</p>
<p>Shrills, and the blood-stained tabernacle shakes</p>
<p>With heels triumphant tapping. All who come&mdash;</p>
<p>Many there are who come&mdash;learn soon or late</p>
<p>The flavour of the cudgel. At the end</p>
<p>All human powers defied, the hangman trick'd</p>
<p>By childlike wile, and hois'd with his own halter,</p>
<p>A day of reckoning comes. The unseen world</p>
<p>A minister sends forth who terrifies</p>
<p>The heart that knew no terror; turns the song</p>
<p>Of triumph to a long wail of despair;</p>
<p>And this most wicked puppet goes below</p>
<p>The curtain of his booth.</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Jing.</i> <span class="i10">A moral play!</span></p>

<h2>WELL PROTECTED;</h2>

<h3>OR, WHAT IT WILL COME TO.</h3>

<p>A Demonstration was held yesterday afternoon at
St. Giles's Hall, in connection with the Imperial Association,
for the raising of Agricultural and other Prices,
"to protest still further against the late unrestricted
ability to live on their means enjoyed by the British
Middle Classes," and "to take ulterior measures for
rendering it more impossible." A large number of
members of the Association were assembled, among whom
were the Duke of <span class="smcap">Glutland</span>, the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">James Mowther</span>,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gruntz</span>, Mr. C. W. <span class="smcap">Bray</span>, M.P., and others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Flowerd Mispent</span>, M.P., said he was proud to
take the chair on such an occasion, and to congratulate
the assembly on the immense progress made in the
country of the principles they were met to advocate.
("<i>Hear, hear!</i>") Their great object had been, by
forcing the Government to put a prohibitive tax on all
foreign imports whatever, to so stimulate home industries,
that while the producer flourished at the expense
of the consumer, the latter, representing four-fifths of
the nation, was driven to the verge of desperation by
a general rise of prices, that he was powerless either to
stave off or meet. (<i>Loud cheers.</i>) He thought that the
great bulk of the Middle Classes of the country must, if
not already hopelessly ruined, at least have got it pretty
hot. (<i>Laughter.</i>) Take his own case. Owing to the
new import duties levied on foreign wool and silk, the
tweed suit in which he stood up before them on that
platform had been charged to him by his tailor at
&pound;37 15s. (<i>laughter</i>), while his hat, for the appearance
of which he could not say much, had cost him &pound;5 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
(<i>Renewed laughter.</i>) Such prices as these must tell in
the long run on the pocket of that great enemy of
national industry, the "Consumer." (<i>Cheers.</i>)</p>

<p>The Chairman then read letters of apology from the
Duke of <span class="smcap">Twickenham</span>, Lord <span class="smcap">Starch</span>, and Baron
<span class="smcap">Dimock</span>, M.P., who declared their readiness to favour
any motion calculated to stimulate a still further rise of
prices. Mr. <span class="smcap">Jollis</span>, M.P., wrote in a similar sense, and
in a letter expressing regret that he was unable to be
present, Lord <span class="smcap">Hapence</span> said:&mdash;The brilliant future that
is now dawning on the prospects of the British Agricultural
Interests must be patent to all. Only yesterday I
was charged 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in a local hotel bill for a small
<i>omelette</i>, and, on asking for some explanation, was
informed by the waiter that since the importation of
French eggs had ceased, the market price of those
procurable from English poultry had risen to 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
(<i>cheers</i>), and they were not to be relied on at that. This
is as it should be. Need I say I paid my bill, not only
without a murmur, but with positive satisfaction.
(<i>Loud cheers.</i>)</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_281" >[pg 281]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Mulligan</span>, M.P., wrote:&mdash;"Your meeting
 is a very important one, and
has my cordial support. But with British-made
ladies' gloves at &pound;1 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pair,
British-made chocolate at 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pound,
and British-made silver watches at &pound;38 a
piece, it cannot be denied that the absence
of foreign competition has favourably affected
home prices. May this encouraging catalogue
be continued. I hear, too, that since prohibitive
duty has been imposed on the importation
of petroleum the coarsest kinds of
composite candles have been selling at 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a pound. Living for the Middle Classes
must be getting unendurable. I hail the
prospect as a hopeful sign of the times."
(<i>Cheers.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Joynter</span>, the Chairman of the Association,
then rose to move the first Resolution:&mdash;"That in consideration of the fact that,
though the threepenny halfpenny loaf was
now at 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, and that though the agricultural
labourer was paying 4<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> a pound
for bacon, &pound;3 17<i>s.</i> for a smock, and &pound;1 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for a second-hand spade, and that yet, notwithstanding
these fiscal advantages, he did
not seem entirely satisfied with his improved
condition, the meeting should urge upon the
State, the necessity of imposing still further
prohibitive duties on foreign imports in the
hope of introducing even greater complications
into the vexed question of how to make
the British Consumer entirely support the
British Producer."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waitland</span> seconded the motion. He
added, however, that notwithstanding the
undeniably flourishing condition of British
trade at home, he could not regard its prospects
as equally satisfactory abroad. Owing
to the retaliatory action of Foreign Governments,
our Exports appeared somehow entirely
to have disappeared. (<i>Laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gruntz</span>, said that was so. Still there
could be no doubt as to its healthy progress
in our midst, and that reflection ought to
quiet the misgivings and comfort the heart of
the ardent Imperial Associationist. He
had in his pocket at that moment a British-made
cigar. (<i>Cheers.</i>) It hadn't a nice
flavour, it wouldn't draw, and it cost him
12s. 6d.&mdash;(<i>laughter</i>)&mdash;still, it was made of
British-grown tobacco, and that was everything.
(<i>Hear, hear!</i>) Perhaps it was in
their wine that people of his class suffered
most. In the old days he used to drink Dry
Monopole; but since a Government duty of
&pound;20 a dozen was imposed on all imported
Champagne, he had had to have his from
the "British Home-manufactured Wine
Company;" and, though they charged him
eleven guineas a dozen for it, and he believed
it frequently made his guests seriously ill,
still he felt he was supporting a "home industry,"
and did not scruple to put it freely
before them. (<i>Roars of laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>After the enthusiastic singing of "<i>Rule
Britannia</i>" by the whole meeting, a vote of
thanks to the Chairman brought the proceedings,
which were of a very animated character,
to a conclusion.</p>

<h2>THE PLUCK OF GGGRRANDDDOLLLMANN'S CAMP.</h2>

<h3>(<i>A Story of the Welsh Gold Fields.</i>)</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Britt Part.</span></p>

<p>There was commotion in Gggrrandddolllmann's Camp. It could
not have been a fight, for in those days, just when gold had been
discovered on Welsh soil, such things as fights were unknown. And
yet the entire settlement were assembled. The schools and libraries
were not only deserted, but <span class="smcap">Jones's</span> Coffee Palace had contributed
its tea-drinkers, who, it will be remembered, had calmly continued
their meal when even such an exciting paper as the <i>Grocers'
Journal</i> had arrived. The whole Camp was collected before a rude
cabin on the outer edge of the clearing. Conversation was carried
on in a low tone, but the name of a man was frequently repeated. It
was a name familiar enough in the Camp&mdash;"W. E. G.&mdash;a first-rate
feller." Perhaps the less said of him the better. He was a strong,
but, it is to be feared, a very unstable person. However, he had sent
them a message, when messages were exceptional. Hence the
excitement.</p>

<p>"You go in there, <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>," said a prominent citizen, addressing
one of the loungers; "go in there, and see if you can make it out.
You've had experience in them things."</p>

<p>Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection. <span class="smcap">Taffy</span> had once been
the collector for a Trades Union Society, and it had been from some
informality in performing his duty that Gggrrandddolllmann's
Camp was indebted for his company. The crowd approved the
choice, and <span class="smcap">Taffy</span> was wise enough to bow to the majority.</p>

<p>The assemblage numbered about a hundred men. Physically they
exhibited no indication of their past lives and character. They were
ordinary Britons, and there was nothing to show they had been
less contented than their neighbours; and yet these men, in spite
of their loneliness, had never wanted for a single reform. Until
now they had been absolutely satisfied with their lot.</p>

<p>There was a solemn hush as <span class="smcap">Taffy</span> entered the Post Office. It
was known that he was reading the despatch. Then there was a
sharp querulous cry&mdash;a cry unlike anything heard before in the Camp.
It was muttered by <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>. He told them that the document called
upon the whole community to ask for Disestablishment and Home
Rule. The Camp rose to its feet as one man. It was proposed to explode
a barrel of dynamite in imitation of the Irish Nationalists, but in
consideration of the position of the Camp, which would certainly
have been blown to pieces, better counsels prevailed, and there was
merely a cutting of bludgeons from the trees the levelling of which
W. E. G. was known to love so well.</p>

<p>Then the door was opened, and the anxious crowd of men, who had
already formed themselves into a <i>queue</i>, entered in single file. On a
table lay the document they had come to read.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>, with a singular mixture of authority
and <i>ex officio</i> complacency; "gentlemen will please pass in at the
front door and out of the back. Them as wishes to contribute anything
towards the carrying out of the written wishes of the document
will find a hat handy."</p>

<p>The first man entered with his hat on; he uncovered, however,
as he looked at the writing, and so unconsciously set an example to
the next. In such communities good and bad actions are catching.
As the procession filed in, comments were audible. "A lot for the
money!" "Just like him!" "Gets a deal into three lines!"
And so on. The contributions were as characteristic. A life assurance
policy, a pledge to abstain from intoxicating drinks, several
volumes on political economy.</p>

<h3>THE NEW SHYLOCK.</h3>

<p><i>From a Portrait sketched by the Great McDermott, Q.C., during a recent
Irish Trial.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<p>So the despatch was read and re-read a score of times, and it was
found necessary to give it a name. The natives of Wales are generally
sagacious, and so they gave it the name of the Pluck. For the
sake of the Pluck they did everything. It was certain, of late, they
had not been very successful. They had certainly not paid their
rents, and refused to patronise the Parson, and so the work of
degeneration began in Gggrrandddolllmann's Camp. Instead of
working as of old, the inhabitants gave up labour and shouted to one
another. They repeated the phrases of the despatch crying, "Be
worthy of yourself, gallant little Wales," "Remember Michelstown!"
and went to sleep. Before the arrival of the despatch they
had been a clean, hard-working, thrifty race. Latterly, however,
there had been a rude attempt to let things go from bad to worse.
The newly discovered mines were deserted and all industry was at a
discount. "It is the Pluck of Gggrrandddolllmann's Camp that's
doing it," said <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>, as he gazed at the document as it lay on
the table before him.</p>

<p>But at length things came to a crisis. The converted miners, as
it has been explained, refused to work, and then neglected to pay
their rents. Then came evictions, supported by the law. There was
a confusion of staves and bayonets, buck-shot and black-thorn sticks.
The Camp disappeared amidst much excitement. Some of the
Campers emigrated, and others were sent to gaol. <span class="smcap">Taffy</span> was
missing. At length he was found in a ditch, holding a postcard
bearing some warlike words, and signed "W. E. G."</p>

<p>"I have got the Pluck with me now," he said, as he was arrested;
and the strong man, clinging to the thin document so full of wild
advice, as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw, was marched
off to prison!</p>

<h2>THE PROFESSOR AT THE DINNER-TABLE.</h2>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Mahaffy's</span> book on <i>The Art of Conversation</i>, seems
witty, and (in parts) wise. People who want to learn to talk well in
society had better consult the genial Professor, who declares that the
art can be acquired. In fact he hands to each of his readers, across
the visionary "walnuts and the wine," the pinch of Attic Salt which
seasons dinner-parties. The theory must, of course, be taken <i>cum
grano</i>. A few hints (strangely omitted in <span class="smcap">Mahaffy's</span> "Haffy
Thoughts,") are here appended:&mdash;</p>

<p>Should you happen to be in company with a number of eminent
Statesmen belonging to one Party (say, at a dinner, when they can't
get away from you,) mind and point out in a loud voice what you
conceive to have been the chief errors of policy which they committed
in their last Ministry, and what would have been <i>your</i> line in their
place. If they are smarting under recent defeat, and have just been
turned out of Office, they will be sure to thank you heartily for your
kind advice.</p>

<p>Supposing politicians of every shade of opinion to be present,
your best course will be to at once introduce some "burning" subject
of the day&mdash;say, Home Rule, or the personal character of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> or Lord <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>. Your host will be delighted,
and you will be surprised to find what a brisk conversation you have
initiated.</p>

<p>Always talk "shop." It gives local colour to your style. For
instance, if you are a lawyer, and you see another legal gentleman at
table, engage him in a conversation as to "that curious Equity point
in the case of <i>The Queen</i> v. <i>the Executors of Muggins, deceased</i>,
before the V.-C." Make your comments as technical as possible. If
you don't soon "get the table in a roar," it will be astonishing.
By the way, there are two kinds of "roar."</p>

<p>Avoid the least appearance of shyness. This is a pushing age.
If you are really bashful by nature, assume a haughty and forbidding
demeanour to cover it. This will make you universally liked.</p>

<p>Spice your talk with jokes. Invent at least six good puns for use
at any dinner to which you may be invited, and bring them out,&mdash;naturally,
if you can, but at any rate <i>bring them out!</i> <i>E.g.</i> If you
are in Dublin, in a company consisting of fervid Nationalists, who
bitterly resent the imprisonment of their Chief Magistrate, remark
jocosely that "you hope his Lordship is not suffering much from <i>mal
de Mayor</i>!" Conversely, when present at a dinner of Loyalists,
refer to the eminent Liberal-Unionist Leader as "<span class="smcap">Half-Hartington</span>."
In either case your host is sure to ask you to come again.</p>

<p><i>Monopolise</i> the conversation. <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span> did this, and so did
<span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>, so why shouldn't you? You may be a <span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>
without knowing the fact.</p>

<p>Remember that people like <i>anecdotes</i>. This is how <span class="smcap">Hayward</span> got
his reputation. Don't hesitate because somebody has said that "all
the good stories have been told." If so, tell them again without
flinching.</p>

<p>Practise allusive and apparently unconscious swagger in private.
When you are sure that you can refer to "my friend the Duke of
St. <span class="smcap">David's</span>," at a dinner-party without the slightest change of
inflexion in your voice and in a perfectly natural manner, you are
fitted to adorn any society&mdash;even the lowest.</p>

<p>Never humour women who try to talk learnedly. Bring the conversation
down to feeding-bottles and keep it there. They will in
reality appreciate your kindness and knowledge of female nature,
even if they appear at the moment to resent it deeply.</p>

<p><i>Pussy (a fine young woman&mdash;but past the kitten stage).</i> Oh, it's all
the same to <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><i>Adorer.</i> Well, I've ordered Vermicelli Soup, and <i>Sole au gratin</i>.
Now, you must try and think what you'd like to follow. (<i>Tentatively.</i>)
A Cutlet?</p>

<p><i>Pussy (with infinite contempt for such want of originality).</i> A
Cutlet&mdash;the <i>idea</i>!</p>

<p><i>Adorer (abashed).</i> I thought perhaps&mdash;but look down the list.
(<span class="smcap">Pussy</span> <i>glances down it with eyes which she tries to render uninterested.</i>)
"<i>Vol au vent &agrave; l' Herbaliste</i>,"&mdash;that looks as if it would be
rather good. Shall we try that?</p>

<p><i>Pussy.</i> You may if you like&mdash;I shan't touch it myself.</p>

<p><i>Adorer.</i> Well, look here, then, "<i>Rognons saut&eacute;s Ven&eacute;zienne</i>,"&mdash;Kidneys,

Potatoes, darling. (<i>The</i> Waiter <i>suspects he is being trifled with.</i>)
Do you prefer them <i>saut&eacute;s</i>, fried, or in chips,&mdash;or what?</p>

<p><i>Pussy (with the lofty indifference of an ethereal nature).</i> I'm sure
I don't care how they're done!</p>

<p><i>Adorer.</i> Then&mdash;Potato-chips, Waiter.</p>

<p><i>Adorer.</i> I don't mean to the dinner&mdash;but to having you to talk

orange, which he eats with an air of severe reproof. The</i>  Bad B.
